    "Of the 19 columns in the reduced dataframe, 16 of them are numeric (14 float and 2 int). These values can all be converted to a single numeric type (e.g. float64) upon transformation into a tensor. However, there are also 3 'object'-type variables that are unable to be processed by the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first 2 non-numeric columns are 'type1' and 'type2', which tell us the types of the first and second muon respectively. Their 'type' classifies them as either a global muon (G), or a tracker muon (T). The other non-numeric variable is 'class', which tells us the type of the meson created by the collision, either J/psi or Upsilon.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few options for dealing with these variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Label encoding or assigning category codes. These methods assign an integer value to every possible string value. This is a very efficient method of converting non-numeric variables but can easily be misinterpreted by the neural network. Some machine learning models, including neural networks, will treat integer-encoded data as numeric, and make assumptions that are not true for categorical data, leading to incorrect assumptions and correlations. This can be avoided by using embedding layers in the neural network.\n",
    "2) One-hot encoding. This avoids the pitfalls of integer-encoding, but increases the dimensionality of the problem. Certain methods of one-hot encoding also produce Boolean values instead of numeric ones, which also cannot be interpreted by the neural network.\n",
    "3) Deleting the non-numeric values. This avoids the problem of encoding the data, but can lead to important variables being neglected and the neural network not learning the correct connections. If we decide not to include a certain variable, we must have a good reason for doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "In deciding which of these method to use, we should consider the following points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Proportion of each value in 'type1'. This column contains only 1 unique value. As we found in Q1, 'type1' contained only 'G' values, so 100% of these particles are global muons. This variable can be immediately ignored as there can be no correlation between 'type1' and 'class'.\n",
    "* Proportion of each value in 'type2'. This column contains both 'G' and 'T' values, although around 90% of the samples have a 'G' value. This is a relatively small portion of the samples, especially when the division of class among the samples is a 50/50 split.\n",
    "* Feature importance. In Q1, after training a decision tree, the relative importance of each feature was plotted. The importance of 'type2' was one of the lowest, at only 0.2%. We should weigh up the potential problems of introducing extra parameters into the dataframe with how useful the result may or may not be to the resulting neural network.\n",
    "* The type of each ingoing muon ('G' or 'T') is not a physical property of the muon, or a reflection of the physics governing it. It is a parameter denoting how the muon was detected, either locally or globally. As this only refers to the equipment used to detect the particle, and not information about the particle itself, it should not have any effect on the particle created.\n",
    "* 'class' is our target variable, and cannot be ignored or deleted, so it __must__ be encoded using one of the above methods.\n",
    "* The issues with integer-encoding don't apply to target data. The neural network treats labels differently to input data, because it only uses them to compare prediction with reality, not to learn connections. This means the 'class' variable can be label or category encoded with no loss of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these considerations, the most efficient choice going forward is to remove the 'type1' and 'type2' columns entirely, and to encode the 'class' data using integer labels."
